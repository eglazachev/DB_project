Project contains creation sql, dummy_data filling, modifying script, some typical queries
dump file and diagram. Some correction of the structure of DB were made on the fly and were 
not replaced into creation script. I made it intensionally to let you follow the flow of
my work. Anyway I understand I finished my project lately and do not pretend to get more 
than usual homework check. This is honest.

This project is a rather modest attempt to copy the liquipedia project.
I've tried to realize only very simple features from original project of liquipedia.
Unfortunately I underestimate the amount of required time to perform more qualitative DB.
Never the less I tried to do my best through these days to reach at least acceptable project.
Of course some ideas haven't been implermented here due to its difficulty. Some part of this
project should've been based on NoSQL base.
I hope after reaching the level of real data collectioning I'll be able to get some benefits
even from this tiny project. Because it is the part of my daily interests.

In general this DB contains structure to store the skeleton of cybersport system:
Disciplines > teams > players
Disciplines > tournaments > matches < cast_studios
Also it is possible to collect some statistics from the results and able to remember some
history. I plan to add some bookmaker history for matches and will get analytics to
make some statistical bets based on it))))

I'm ashamed a bit in front of you Timofey, 'cause you are totally good teacher. I'm sorry
I didn't perform as well as you teach me. But at the same time during the work on
project I'd remembered every lesson and it was completely enough for now to avoid 
some crucial mistakes. 

p.s. Thank you very much Timofey.
